# Finger Counting

Welcome to the **Finger Counting** project. This project is designed to demonstrate a real-time finger counting system using computer vision techniques. The script detects the number of fingers raised and presents an appropriate image and numerical representation on the screen.

## Project Overview

The **Finger Counting** showcases the implementation of a real-time finger counting system:

- **Finger Detection:** The project utilizes computer vision to accurately identify the number of fingers raised by a user.

- **Visual Representation:** Based on the detected finger count, the script displays a corresponding image and the numerical count on the screen.
