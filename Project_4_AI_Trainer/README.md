# AI Trainer

Welcome to the **AI Trainer** project. This project introduces an innovative application of computer vision technology to assist in fitness training. By detecting the positions of arms or legs and monitoring changes in angles, the script can track repetitions of exercises like bicep curls or squats.

## Project Overview

The **AI Trainer** showcases the fusion of fitness training with computer vision technology:

- **Pose Detection:** The project employs computer vision techniques to accurately detect the positions of arms or legs during exercises.

- **Repetition Tracking:** Based on changes in angles, the script monitors exercise repetitions such as bicep curls and squats.
