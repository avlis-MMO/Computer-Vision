# Hand Gesture Virtual Mouse

Welcome to the **Hand Gesture Virtual Mouse** project. This project introduces a creative application of computer vision technology by transforming hand gestures into virtual mouse control. Using computer vision, the script detects hand movements and gestures to move the cursor and perform mouse clicks.

## Project Overview

The **Hand Gesture Virtual Mouse** exemplifies the innovative use of hand gestures as a virtual mouse:

- **Hand Detection:** The project employs computer vision to accurately identify and track the position of the user's hand.

- **Mouse Control:** Based on detected hand movements and gestures, the script translates them into cursor movements and mouse click actions.
