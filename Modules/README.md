# Custom Modules for Recognition Projects

Welcome to the **Custom Modules** folder, where I've gathered specialized modules crafted to enhance specific recognition projects. These modules are tailored to be seamlessly integrated into codes that focus on face, hand, and pose recognition, with Mediapipe as the foundational framework.

## Modules Overview

This folder houses a collection of custom modules designed to provide added functionalities and efficiencies for recognition-focused projects:

- **Face Recognition:** Modules catering to tasks related to detecting and analyzing facial features and expressions.

- **Hand Recognition:** Specialized modules targeting hand gesture detection, finger tracking, and more.

- **Pose Recognition:** Modules tailored for pose estimation, posture analysis, and human pose-related tasks.

## Module Utility

Each custom module within this folder is developed with the goal of simplifying and enhancing the process of incorporating advanced recognition features in my projects.
