# Computer Vision Drawing

Welcome to the **Computer Vision Drawing** repository. This project introduces an interactive and creative use of computer vision technology by enabling users to draw on the screen using gestures. With the ability to select various colors and even erase, this project transforms hand gestures into a virtual canvas.
