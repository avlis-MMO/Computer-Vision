# Safety Equipment Detection

Welcome to the **Safety Equipment Detection** project. This project highlights the application of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for detecting safety equipment in various images and videos. By utilizing YOLO, the script identifies and classifies different types of safety equipment. The weight used was obtained by training the model on a dataset from ROBOFLOW with safety equipment.

## Project Overview

The **Safety Equipment Detection** underscores the potential of YOLO for safety equipment recognition:

- **YOLO Model:** The project harnesses the YOLO algorithm for efficient and accurate detection of safety equipment.

- **Safety Gear Detection:** Based on the trained YOLO model, the script identifies and categorizes different safety equipment types within images and videos.
