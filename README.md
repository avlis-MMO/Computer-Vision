# Computer Vision Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Computer Vision Projects Repository**! This repository showcases a series of innovative projects where computer vision technology is harnessed to create interactive and practical applications. Through these projects, I've explored various aspects of computer vision, from using body landmarks for volume control and mouse movement to implementing AI-powered object detection and classification using the YOLO model.

## Project Overview

This repository presents a diverse collection of computer vision projects:

- **Gesture-Based Volume Control:** Explore the project where hand landmarks are utilized to adjust the volume of your PC with intuitive gestures.

- **Hand Gesture Virtual Mouse:** Discover how hand landmarks can be transformed into a virtual mouse, enabling hands-free cursor control and clicks.

- **AI Trainer for Repetitions:** Learn about the implementation that tracks the movements of your body and calculates repetitions during exercises like bicep curls and squats.

- **Virtual Painter:** Explore the project where hand marks are used to choose different colors and draw on the screen.

- **Object Detection with YOLO:** Dive into the world of deep learning as the YOLO model is employed to detect and classify objects, from cars in videos to safety equipment in images.
  
- **Face Recognition:** Through face recognition an attendance app was developed to check the attendance of people and update their information on a DB.
