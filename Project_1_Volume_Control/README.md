# Volume Control

Welcome to the **Volume Control** project repository. This project showcases an innovative approach to adjusting the PC's volume through computer vision techniques. By detecting the distance between two fingers, the script dynamically controls the volume level.

## Project Overview

The **Volume Control** project demonstrates the implementation of volume control based on hand gestures:

- **Hand Gesture Detection:** The project employs computer vision techniques to accurately measure the distance between two fingers.

- **Volume Adjustment:** Based on the measured distance, the script dynamically adjusts the PC's volume, providing a hands-free approach to volume control.
