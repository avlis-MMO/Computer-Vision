# Object Detection with YOLO

Welcome to the **Object Detection with YOLO** project. This project demonstrates the application of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection. By utilizing YOLO, the script detects cars in a video and provides a count of how many cars appear.

## Project Overview

The **Object Detection with YOLO** showcases the capabilities of the YOLO model for object recognition:

- **YOLO Model:** The project employs the YOLO algorithm for efficient and accurate object detection.

- **Car Detection:** Based on the trained YOLO model, the script identifies and tracks cars within a video stream.
